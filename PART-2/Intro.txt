In PART-1 we create a spatialized signal, but only for 1 angle.
If we wanna create in all 360 angle with that code, it would be too time consuming.
So in PART-2 I will explain how to create it with less effort.

========================

First, run create_filename.m

Normally, when we wanna save the created audio in wav format, and we type like this (just as in PART-1):
filename = 'clean_90.wav';
audiowrite(filename, bi, fs);
The created audio will be saved in the folder where the code was.

It's not wrong, but when we created so many audio, and we want to automatically organize it in one folder, we should do it this way:
filename = 'E:\TUGAS AKHIR\SC\OB-NH\PART-2\clean\clean_90.wav';
audiowrite(filename, bi, fs);

Therefore, nh_filename.m create a list of filenames along with its directory.

Previously in PART-1 we only saved the binaural signal, but in PART-2 we need to saved the left, right, and binaural signal. I will explain further in the next part. Just make sure to create txt filename for left, right, and binaural signal.

========================

Second, create a list of azimuth angle, we need it to load HRIR
Run this in command window:

fid = fopen('E:\TUGAS AKHIR\SC\PART-2\angle.txt', 'w');
angle = string(5:5:360);
fprintf(fid, '%s\r\n', angle);
fclose(fid);

========================

Third, run spatialize_signal
If you wanna check the extracted spatial cues (ITD and ILD), click itd_all and ild_all in the workspace. There will be 72 data for 72 angles. The first row is the data for 5 degrees, the second row for 10 degrees, and so on. It follows the order of angle in the angle.txt. You can copy this data to your excel, make a plot of spatial cues vs angle, and see how these cues change over angle.

Voila! It's done!
